# Frontend Getting Started

The Flash News Frontend is a React-based web application that provides an intuitive and interactive interface for the Flash News platform. Users can browse, share, and organize news articles while engaging with a personalized social feed.

## Overview

This application allows users to:

- View a curated feed of shared articles.
- Organize news articles into public or private collections.
- Interact with posts through likes and comments.
- Customize profiles with profile pictures, bios, and tags.

The frontend integrates with the backend APIs for seamless functionality, offering a responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies

- React: Component-based library for building the user interface.
- Material UI: Pre-styled components for responsive and modern design.
- ESLint: For code linting and adherence to project standards.
- Prettier: Ensures code formatting consistency.
- React Router: For navigation and routing across pages.

## Set Up

Follow the subsequent steps to be ready to run the app:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
